        <h1>Explaining The Positions Of Baseball</h1>
        <p> Baseball's 9 fielders each have their own job and responsibility. </p>
            <p> This website will familiarise you with each position and their skill set. </p>

        <h2>The Pitcher (P)</h2>
         <p>The pitcher is responsible for starting the play.</p>
         <p>He pitches the ball to the batter in order to get him out, via strike out or forcing weak contact.</p>
         <p>Pitchers aren't expected to bat, especially with the implementation of the Designated Hitter.</p>
         <p>Pitchers can field bunts and liners hit to them, but will mostly duck so as to not intefere with his teammates.</p>
         <p>They must have sublime stamina, cool consistency and an amazing arm to deliver unhittable pitches.</p>
         <p>Pitchers are number 1 in the scorekeeing system.</p>

        <h2>The Catcher (C)</h3>
         <p>Crouched behind home plate is the catcher, who catches the pitchers pitches that aren't hit. They wear heavy protective gear for these pitches.</p>
         <p>Catchers must be smart at organising the defense and instructing them in moments of uncertaincy.</p>
         <p>A catcher's primary job is to guide the pitcher on how to pitch to the current batter.</p>
         <p>He must also be ready to throw out any runners on base attempting a steal, requiring quick reactions and a powerful arm.</p>
         <p>Catchers aren't the fastest when batting due to their constant crouch and heavy equipment, so they prioritise power.</p>
         <p>Catchers are number 2 in the scorekeeing system.</p>
        <!-- put a catcher picture here -->
        <h2>The First Baseman (1B) </h2>
         <p>Guarding the first of the bases, the first baseman mostly catches throws from other infielders to force-out a batter-runner.</p>
         <p>When a runner is on first, the first baseman stands at first at the ready to catch pickoffs from the pitcher.
         <p>A first baseman's handedness won't matter much, but lefties have an easier time since the glove will be on the right hand, closer to his teammates.</p>
         <p>A taller first baseman can catch wilder throws and catch hard liners down the first base line. They must also field sac bunts to first base.</p>
         <p>Since their position is easily replacable, their batting skill is of utmost importance. First Basemen don't need to be agile, so a power slugging batter is played here.</p>
         <p>A first baseman's glove has more padding and longer fingers than a normal infielder glove, and they're tied together for more surface area.</p>
         <p>First Basemen are number 3 in the scorekeeing system.</p>
         <!-- put a 1B picture here -->
        <h2>The Second Baseman (2B) </h2>
         <p>At the midpoint of the diamond is the second baseman. He shares the duty of second base with the shortstop.</p>
         <p>Second Basemen need tremendous lateral agility to field any balls hit between first and second base, so he can move either direction quickly.</p>
         <p>He is responsible for catching the catcher's throws to tag out a base-stealer. He also goes to the outfield to relay throws from center and right field back to the infield.</p>
         <p>Second basemen must make throws to their left and right quickly and accurately to pull off double plays. Since they're closest to first, they often have the weakest arm.</p>
         <p>A second baseman's agility helps when on base, so he must be proficient when batting to make good contact, either to get on base or score runners.</p>
         <p>Second Basemen are number 4 in the scorekeeing system.</p>
        <!-- put a 2B picture here -->
        <h2>The Shortstop (SS) </h2>
         <p>As the second baseman's partner in the middle, the shortstop is the team's best defender. He's ofter referred to simply as "short".</p>
         <p>Shortstops field any balls between second and third base. He covers second when the second baseman has to field the ball.</p>
         <p>Shortstops have the same responsibilities as the second baseman, but he needs a stronger arm and sharper reactions, since he has a longer throw to make.</p>
         <p>He captains the infield, often taking charge of pop-ups and calling out steal attempts and relay throws. He also catches pickoffs to second base.</p>
         <p>Shortstops relay throws from left and center field, but can relay from right. Shortstops can also catch pop-ups in the shallow outfield.</p>
         <p>Shortstops, like catchers, focused primarily on defense, so they weren't good batters. But modern shortstops are some of the best hitters, making them the full package.</p>
         <p>Shortstops are number 6 in the scorekeeing system.</p>
        <!-- put a SS picture here -->
        <h2>The Third Baseman (3B) </h2>
         <p>Playing at the "Hot Corner", the third baseman needs quick reactions and no fear. Since most hitters are righties that pull the ball, third basemen field more than first base.</p>
         <p>Third base is the farthest from first, so the third baseman needs the strongest arm of the infield, as he may need to throw from foul territory.</p>
         <p>Most batters bunt down the third base foul line, so third basemen must quickly field the ball and throw to first. Sometimes they play closest to the batter in preparation.</p>
         <p>Since he's so close, he needs lightning reactions to catch line drives down third. They also tag out ambitious runners attempting to steal third.</p>
         <p>Third basemen don't defend as much as a shortstop, so they must be better at batting, mostly providing a balance of contact and power.</p>
         <p>Third basemen are number 5 in the scorekeeing system.</p>
        <!-- put a 3B picture here -->
        <h2>The Center Fielder (CF) </h2>
         <p>As the outfield commander, the center fielder must have exceptional speed, jumping and ball tracking abilities. He's the most important defender of the outfield.</p>
         <p>He plays in the middle of the outfield, in between th second baseman and shortstop. The area between these 3 is known colloquially as the "Bermuda Triangle".</p>
         <p>He, like the other outfielders, use wider gloves with bigger webbing to make catches easier. The faster the center fielder is, the more area he can cover in the field.</p>
         <p>A powerful arm is required for the center fielder, as he may need to throw the ball from the wall to the cutoff man. He also covers for other outfielders if they make an error.</p>
         <p>The ability to scale the outfield wall to rob home runs is a nifty skill to have, especially for the center fielder. He also calls of the other outfielders to clear uncertainty.</p>
         <p>The center fielder's fast speed helps with baserunning, so he needs good batting skill to get on base and use it to steal bases and score runs.</p>
         <p>If the other two outfielders can burden more defensive responsibilities, the center fielder can bat for more power, which some modern ones are trending towards.</p>
         <p>Center fielders are number 8 in the scorekeeing system.</p>
        <!-- put a CF picture here -->
        <h2>The Left Fielder (LF) </h2>
         <p>The left fielder is most likely one of the team's most skilled batters, since out of the three outfielders, he has the least defensive requirements.</p>
         <p>He plays to the center fielder's right, and closer to the infield due to the ballpark's curved shape. He also fields any batted balls that get past short and third.</p>
         <p>While he still must cover ground and catch fly balls, even to rob home runs, his arm doesn't need to be that strong, since he is the closest outfielder to third base.</p>
         <p>The left fielder can rely on cutoff throws to home plate and third base. If he dares, he can make a direct throw to third base or home.</p>
         <p>Fewer defensive duties must be balanced by superior batting skills and since he has less ground to cover, he can bat for more power. He's the best hitter of the outfield.</p>
         <p>Left fielders are number 7 in the scorekeeing system.</p>
        <!-- put a LF picture here -->
        <h2>The Right Fielder (RF) </h2>
         <p>The last defensive position to mention, the right fielder is characterised by his cannon of an arm.</p>
         <p>He is the furthest outfielder from third base, so he needs th strongest arm of the outfielders, even more than the center fielder.</p>
         <p>Other than that, his catching abilities, speed and jumping skill is like that of the left fielder. However, he can afford to skip the cutoff man due to his arm.</p>
         <p>He plays to the center fielder's left, and closer to the infield due to the ballpark's curved shape. Any batted balls that gets past first and second are fielded by him.</p>
         <p>With less to do than center, he needs to be a better batter, but not necessarily better than the left fielder. Good speed or power must be a trait of a right fielder.</p>
         <p>Right field is notorious in Little League as the position for the team's worst player, as most kids bat right handed and pull-hit so right fielders see little action.</p>
         <p>Right fielders are number 9 in the scorekeeing system.</p>
         <p>    </p>
